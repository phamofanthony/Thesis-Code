1. algorithm_analysis.ipynb is the main entry point 
2. it calls get_results(...) from combined.py that simulates the two functions by calling both defined_results and predefined_results from defined_main.py and predefined_main.py, respectively
3. defined_main.py and predefined_main.py contain the core logic for simulating those algorithms for the given parameters
